Study datapoints are recorded in multiple locations. These locations must match one another. I am tasked with reviewing all records 
on a weekly basis, identifying discrepancies, notifying the team member assigned to the discrepant study of the the issue, requesting
they address the issue, and tracking their progress to ensure they follow through.

This script completed this task automatically, including emailing the appropriate team members.
