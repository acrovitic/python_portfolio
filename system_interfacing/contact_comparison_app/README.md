This app provides users with a GUI-based program that compares a study's contact information listed in a web system against those listed in a shared drive document. Comparison is executed via `difflib` function `SequenceMatcher`, which provides a similarity score that informs the users of whether a name is located in both the document and the web system.

The app removes the need for users to download the web system contact list, locate the shared drive document, and manually compare both documents to determine if an update is required. A user must keep their login credentials in the `username` and `password` fields to run comparisons.
