We recieve updated Protocol documents from multiple studies at various times. These documents must be posted online to two 
different websites, placed in specific folders in a shared drive (while moving off their previous versions), and sending
them to key stakeholders to update critical clinical documents. This must be done for each updated Protocol received.

This script handles all the above described tasks, completing them in a few seconds.
