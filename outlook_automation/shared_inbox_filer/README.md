A shared Outlook inbox is how our client sends requests for all 100+ active clinical trials. Each trial has a unique identification number. 
The inbox can easily receive over 100 new emails a day. Each day, a team member was assigned to file off emails on a shared drive, in an 
outlook folder, and to save off attachments. This script automated the task with 100% accuracy.

TODO:(80% complete): complete selenium script to scan for specially categorized emails, download attachment, and upload to document 
     repository websites.
